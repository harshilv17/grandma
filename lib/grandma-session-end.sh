# Installed (async) in grandma-launched projects. When a session ends, it headless-
# distills the transcript into a grandma memory PROPOSAL file (applies nothing,
# commits nothing). You review proposals later with `grandma-review`.

# Reads the hook JSON on stdin to get transcript_path and reason.

# Claude Code session and fires SessionEnd when it finishes. Without this guard that
# re-triggers the distill -> infinite cascade (thousands of runaway processes). We mark
# the distill's environment with GRANDMA_DISTILLING=1; any SessionEnd fired from inside
# a distill sees it and bails. Only a real user session (no such env) proceeds.

# than exec-ing it), it distills in the FOREGROUND after you exit and offers an immediate
# review. It marks the session with GRANDMA_DEFER_DISTILL=1 so this async hook stands down
# and we don't distill the same session twice. Plain `claude` sessions have no such env, so
# the hook still handles them.

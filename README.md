Your AI forgets everything between sessions. Every morning you re-explain your stack, your conventions, your client, your life. Grandma fixes that. She gives Claude Code a persistent memory that is **yours** (plain markdown in your own git repo), **separated by sweater** (one per part of your life, kept apart), and **learned passively** while you work.

> **A sweater is a context you keep separate memory in** — one company, one client, your
> job hunt, your writing. Open a sweater and grandma remembers everything about *that* part
> of your life and nothing from the others. Your projects live inside a sweater.

Grandma does three things a single session never can:

- **Keeps your worlds apart.** Client A's memory never shows up in a client B session — enforced by a test, not by discipline.
- **Remembers across all of them, forever.** Tell her once, in any session; every future session in that sweater knows.
- **Analyzes your whole history and acts on it.** She can study weeks of your chats and turn what she finds into memory:

```text
$ grandma "analyse my last 2 weeks of chats, write how I actually write, and make it part of my identity"
grandma> read 1,297 of your messages across 19 sessions.
         ✓ wrote global/style.md (3 registers: how you type, how your work should read, how you write prompts)
         ✓ updated global/identity.md
         review it: git -C ~/.grandma diff
```

Here is the everyday loop. Teach her once, and a brand new session already knows:

```text
# Monday
$ grandma acme
you> we use pnpm here, never yarn. and never push to main directly.
grandma> ✓ noted (preference) -> acme/facts.md: pnpm only, no direct pushes to main
         ...continues your actual task...

# Thursday, brand new session
$ grandma acme
grandma> ▣ memory: acme loaded · 4 files · ~1.9k tokens
you> set up the new billing service
grandma> Scaffolding with pnpm. I'll open a PR rather than pushing to main.
```

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anshulforyou/grandma/master/install.sh | bash
```

That clones the engine, creates your private memory home, and offers a two-minute interview where grandma learns who you are. Or manually:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/anshulforyou/grandma && cd grandma && ./bin/grandma init
```

Requirements: [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), git, jq, python3. macOS or Linux (Windows via WSL). `grandma doctor` checks everything and tells you how to fix what is missing.

### Tab completion

Optional, and worth it. With it on, `grandma <TAB>` lists your sweaters, `grandma per<TAB>` completes the one you mean, and `grandma acme <TAB>` lists the projects under acme. Add one line to your shell rc:

```sh
# bash: add to ~/.bashrc
eval "$(grandma completions bash)"

# zsh: add to ~/.zshrc, below an existing `autoload -Uz compinit && compinit`
eval "$(grandma completions zsh)"
```

Start a new shell and press TAB after `grandma`. Grandma does not touch your rc file for you, so turning this on stays your call.

### Search your memory

Sometimes you just want to know what she remembers, without starting a session:

```text
$ grandma search pnpm
global/preferences.md:9:- pnpm only, never yarn
acme/facts.md:4:- pnpm workspaces, one lockfile at the root
  2 match(es) in 2 file(s)

$ grandma search acme migrations       # scoped to one sweater
acme/facts.md:6:- Postgres, migrations via atlas only
  1 match(es) in 1 file(s) · sweater acme
```

Read-only, and it never starts Claude. Output is `file:line:text`, so it pipes like grep.
The scoped form searches that sweater alone (not global), so a hit always tells you which
sweater owns the memory. Matching is a case-insensitive literal string — ripgrep when you
have it, grep otherwise, and both are made to agree. Exit codes follow grep: `0` matches,
`1` no matches, `2` bad usage. Pending proposals and watch scratch are not searched; they
are not memory until you accept them.

## How it works

Three layers of memory, loaded in the right amounts at the right times:

```text
global/             who you are, how you like to work        always loaded
<sweater>/            one folder per context: a job, a client, loaded for that sweater only
                    a side project, your job hunt
project CLAUDE.md   deep per-project instructions            auto-loaded in that folder
```

- `grandma acme` assembles global + acme memory and launches Claude Code with it.
- `grandma acme billing-api` also drops you into that project so its CLAUDE.md rides along.
- `grandma` alone shows a picker, including "describe a new sweater" where you explain a new context in plain words and grandma scaffolds it.

Memory lives in `GRANDMA_HOME` (default `~/.grandma`), a git repo that belongs to you. The engine never stores your data next to its own code.

### She learns while you work

During a session, when something worth keeping comes up (a preference, a correction, a fact that changed, a lesson), grandma writes it to the right memory file and tells you in one line:

```text
✓ noted (correction) -> global/preferences.md: never auto-commit, review diffs first
```

Writes land as uncommitted diffs in your memory repo. `git diff` is your review queue. Nothing is committed behind your back.

### She survives the context window

Long sessions hit Claude Code's compaction, which normally drops the instructions grandma injected at launch. Two hooks cover this. The moment compaction happens, grandma re-injects your memory, so hour six behaves like minute one. And just before compaction, it checkpoints the working state of the current task (what you decided, what is done, what is next) and folds that back in too, so the session keeps the thread of its own work and not just your standing preferences. When you exit, grandma looks over the session right then and shows you what she noted, the live diffs plus a drafted proposal, and asks whether to review now or leave it. Nothing is applied without you. (Sessions you did not start with grandma get the same distill quietly in the background, surfaced at your next launch.)

### She watches for your blind spots

```sh
grandma watch start "why are my sessions getting longer?" --weeks 2
```

For two weeks grandma measures every session (duration, turns, tokens, compactions, tool calls) and reads the substantial ones. When the window closes you get a notification and a grounded report: the patterns, the numbers, what to change. It found real bugs in its own development. It will find your habits too.

## Day to day

Eight recipes with real transcripts in [docs/use-cases.md](docs/use-cases.md):

1. Stop re-explaining your stack every session
2. The correction that sticks forever
3. Client A and client B, with contexts that cannot bleed
4. Onboard a new project in five minutes
5. Survive a marathon session
6. End the day, review what she learned
7. Find out why your sessions drag
8. Grandma is not just for work

## Why files, why git

|  | grandma | one big CLAUDE.md | hosted AI memory | vector memory stores |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Your data lives | your disk, your git repo | your repo | their servers | a database |
| Sweater isolation | hard guarantee, tested | one file for everything | opaque | query-dependent |
| Review changes | `git diff` | manual | no | no |
| Learns passively | yes | no | sometimes | app-dependent |
| Survives compaction | yes, self-heals | partially | n/a | n/a |
| Telemetry | none | none | yes | varies |

## Trust

- **12 tested invariants** guard the core promise: loading sweater X injects exactly global + X and nothing else, the engine contains no sweater jargon and no personal data, no secrets in memory, hooks cannot recurse or run away. The suite gates every commit and runs in CI on macOS and Linux.
- **No telemetry, no server, no accounts.** Your memory never leaves your machine.
- Failure modes are documented, not hidden: [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) includes the war stories, like the day a hook recursion produced 4,718 files before the circuit breaker existed.

## Commands

```text
grandma                        pick a sweater, or describe a new one
grandma <sweater> [project]      launch a remembered session
grandma init | doctor          setup and health checks
grandma save <sweater> [project] distill a finished session into memory
grandma review [sweater]         review what background distills proposed
grandma search [sweater] <query> grep across your memory
grandma ingest [sweater]         catalog an existing folder of projects
grandma watch ...              analysis campaigns over your sessions
grandma test [sweater]           verify the integrity invariants
grandma completions bash|zsh   print the shell tab-completion script
grandma knit                   coming next: share a project's memory with a teammate (see below)
```

## Known quirks (v0.1)

- **Exit sessions with Ctrl+D**, not `/exit`. Claude Code's `/exit` skips SessionEnd
  hooks (upstream issue), so the end-of-session distill only runs on Ctrl+D. Manual
  fallback always works: `grandma save <sweater>`.
- Sweater names that collide with subcommands (`init`, `save`, `review`, `search`,
  `ingest`, `watch`, `test`, `doctor`, `help`) are reserved.
- macOS is the daily-driven platform. Linux is CI-tested but younger: if something
  misbehaves, `grandma doctor` first, then an issue with its output.

## Where this is going: remember, watch, knit

Grandma is being built in three phases, and you are looking at the first two.

1. **Remember** (shipped). Scoped memory: who you are, how you work, what each
   context needs. Loaded every session, learned passively, reviewed via git.
2. **Watch** (shipped). She analyzes how you actually work: `grandma watch` measures
   your sessions, reads the substantial ones, and reports the patterns behind your
   long sessions and wasted tokens.
3. **Knit** (next). The sharing phase. Two people work the same project, and each one
   builds their own memory of it locally: the sharp edges, the decisions, the things
   that only bite you once. Knit lets you trade those. You run

   ```sh
   grandma knit share <sweater>
   ```

   and your project memory, personal scope stripped out, goes to your teammate. They
   get a ping, pull it with grandma, and see it laid against their own: a diff between
   your memory and theirs, so each side keeps what it wants. Think git, but for the
   context in your heads instead of the code on disk. Remember builds your memory.
   Watch sharpens it. Knit reconciles yours with a teammate's. It is early and open
   for design: how the two memories merge when they disagree, what gets shared versus
   kept private, how a note's origin is tracked. Contributions and design ideas for
   knit are welcome: open an issue with the `knit` label.

## Roadmap

- **grandma knit: share a project's memory with your team (see above)**
- Adapters beyond Claude Code (Cursor, Codex CLI, aider)
- Community sweater templates (share your best sweater setups)
- Memory rollup (old logs compress instead of growing)

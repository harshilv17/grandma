# Behavioral tests for `grandma completions` - shell tab-completion.
#
# Bites: before this feature `grandma completions` did not exist (it fell through to launch
# and errored). The listers must survive set -u, name every sweater plus the subcommands, and
# resolve a KEBAB scope (home-ops) to a SPACE-FREE project token (a multi-word raw name like
# "Billing API" inserted verbatim would be parsed as a task, not a project).

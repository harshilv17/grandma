# The onboarding hang (trust prompt frozen forever) only reproduces when TWO things are
# true at once: `claude` is on PATH, and stdin is a pipe (as it is under curl|bash). The
# integrity suite and smoke test miss it because CI has no `claude` binary, so the
# interview branch is never taken. This test supplies a FAKE claude and drives install
# through a pipe, then asserts the installer never launches an interactive TUI it cannot
# talk to. It also drives the interactive path (a real pty) to prove the interview DOES
# fire when — and only when — stdin is a terminal.
